SCRIBE: ITERATOR
================

Description:
	This package provides a simple means of replacing multiple
	selected regions with an iterated number value, based on
	the settings defined.

Usage:
	- Use the default Find functionality to search for the multiple
	  occurances you would like to replace with an iterated value.
	- Use the "Find All" option of the search bar so that all
	  occurances are selected.
	- Use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+Alt+N" or the top-level
	  menu item "Scribe Inc." > "Number Iterator" to bring up the
	  iterator prompt
	- You will be greeted with a prompt at the bottom of the Sublime
	  window with three digits, as such "1 1 1"
	- The first digit is the starting number, the second digit is
	  iteration step size, and the final digit is any padding.

Example:
	- Replace "1 1 1" with the values "5, 10, 3" to iterate beginning
	  at five, increasing by ten digits on each iteration, and
	  applying a padding of 3 characters.
	- The above example would output the following replacements:
		005
		015
		025
		035
	  etc...
